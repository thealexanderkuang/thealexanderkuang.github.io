			<p>I am currently studying Computer Game Design at UCSC. I hope at this point that I could call myself a programmer, but you never know,  y'know? I'm most familiar with C/C++, and C#, and Java. I am currently in the 170 capstone series for the CSGD major, and I am apart of Team Orbies, where we work on our game <i>Love Heist Romeo</i>, a quirky little rabbit trying to find love.</p>

			<p>In my free time I like to subject myself to <i>Street Fighter V</i>. If I'm feeling pretty good, I'll pop into <i>Stardew Valley</i> or <i>Deeprock Galactic</i>.
